//! Dining Cryptographers Protocol, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_cryptographers_problem>
//!
//! In cryptography, the dining cryptographers problem studies how to perform a secure multi-party computation of the
//! boolean-XOR function. David Chaum first proposed this problem in the early 1980s and used it as an illustrative
//! example to show that it was possible to send anonymous messages with unconditional sender and recipient
//! untraceability. Anonymous communication networks based on this problem are often referred to as DC-nets (where DC
//! stands for "dining cryptographers").
//!
//! ## Description
//!
//! Three cryptographers gather around a table for dinner. The waiter informs them that the meal has been paid for by
//! someone, who could be one of the cryptographers or the National Security Agency (NSA). The cryptographers respect
//! each other's right to make an anonymous payment, but want to find out whether the NSA paid. So they decide to
//! execute a two-stage protocol.
//!
//! In the first stage, every two cryptographers establish a shared one-bit secret, say by tossing a coin behind a menu
//! so that only two cryptographers see the outcome in turn for each two cryptographers. Suppose, for example, that
//! after the coin tossing, cryptographer A and B share a secret bit 1, A and C share 0, and B and C share 1.
//!
//! In the second stage, each cryptographer publicly announces a bit, which is:
//!
//! - if they didn't pay for the meal, the exclusive OR (XOR) of the two shared bits they hold with their two
//!   neighbours,
//! - if they did pay for the meal, the opposite of that XOR.
//!
//! Supposing none of the cryptographers paid, then A announces 1⨁0 = 1, B announces 1⨁1 = 0, and C announces 0⨁1 = 1.
//! On the other hand, if A paid, she announces ¬(1⨁0) = 0.
//!
//! The three public announcements combined reveal the answer to their question. One simply computes the XOR of the
//! three bits announced. If the result is 0, it implies that none of the cryptographers paid (so the NSA must have paid
//! the bill). Otherwise, one of the cryptographers paid, but their identity remains unknown to the other
//! cryptographers.
//!
//! ## Implementation
//!
//! Prep:
//!     State is "I paid yes/no" and "ordered list of diners".
//! Round 1:
//!    Each diner DMs their neighbour their cointoss.
//!    Outcome: the state of each diner is their own cointoss and the bit they received as a DM, i.e. two bits, one
//!    they sent to one neighbour and the other received by their other neighbour diner.
//! Round 2:
//!    Each diner broadcasts one bit: the XOR (if they didn't pay) or ¬XOR (if they paid) of their two bits.
//!    Outcome: each diner has a set of bits, one for each diner.
//! Post:
//!    Everyone XORs all bits together and interprets the result: 0 => NSA paid; 1 => one of the diners paid.
//!
//! ## Running the example
//!
//! Run the example with `RUST_LOG=trace cargo run dining-cryptographers`.
